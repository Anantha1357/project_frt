        <h3>
        The history of mobile phones covers mobile communication devices that connect wirelessly to the public switched telephone network.
While the transmission of speech by signal has a long history, the first devices that were wireless, mobile,
 and also capable of connecting to the standard telephone network are much more recent. The first such devices were 
 barely portable compared to today's compact hand-held devices, and their use was clumsy.
Drastic changes have taken place in both the networking of wireless communication and the prevalence of its use,
 with smartphones becoming common globally and a growing proportion of Internet access now done via mobile broadband.

                <h3>When talking about mobile usage statistics, one thing we absolutely cannot ignore is the dominance of smartphones. 

                    There are currently 6.8 billion smartphone users worldwide (Statista, 2022). Considering the global population is at 8 billion, that means a smartphone penetration of over 80 percent. 
                    
                    The number of smartphone users is also rising rapidly over time, evidenced by the fact that as recently as in 2016, there were 3.7 billion smartphone users. In other words, the number of smartphone users has increased by a whopping 86.5 percent in just seven years.
                    
                    Smartphone usage is expected to continue to increase in the coming years, breaching seven billion in 2024 before rising further to 7.5 billion by 2026.
